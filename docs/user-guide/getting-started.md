# Getting Started

## What is zmNinjaNg?

zmNinjaNg is a client application for [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com/), an open-source video surveillance system. It lets you:

- View live camera feeds from your ZoneMinder server
- Browse and play back recorded events
- See multiple cameras at once in a montage view
- Receive push notifications when events are detected
- Manage multiple ZoneMinder servers via profiles
- Customize your dashboard with widgets

zmNinjaNg runs on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web from a single codebase. It is a ground-up rewrite of [zmNinja](https://zmninja.zoneminder.com/) using modern web technologies.

## Requirements

### ZoneMinder Server

- ZoneMinder 1.36 or newer
- API access enabled (`OPT_USE_API = 1`)
- A valid SSL certificate (or plain HTTP). Self-signed certificates are supported on mobile (iOS/Android) - enable the toggle in Settings > Connection. On desktop, add your CA to the system trust store. Using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or similar is recommended

### Client

- **Web**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Desktop**: Windows 10+, macOS 11+, or Linux (x86_64)
- **Android**: Android 8.0+
- **iOS**: iOS 15+ (you must build from source - see {doc}`../building/IOS`)

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinjaNg/releases)
2. **Open** the app - you'll land on the Profiles screen
3. **Add a profile** by entering your ZoneMinder server URL, username, and password
4. **Test the connection** - zmNinjaNg will validate your credentials and discover the API
5. **Save** the profile and you're in

See {doc}`installation` for detailed instructions per platform, and {doc}`profiles` for profile configuration options.

## What's Different from zmNinja?

zmNinjaNg is not a port of zmNinja - it's a new application built from scratch. Key differences:

- **Modern UI** - Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- **Faster** - 3-4x faster load times, smoother scrolling with virtualized lists
- **Smaller** - 60-75% smaller app/download size
- **Encrypted credentials** - Passwords are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM (hardware-backed on Android via Android Keystore)
- **No analytics** - No Firebase analytics or third-party tracking
- **Desktop support** - Native desktop apps via Tauri (lighter than Electron)
- **Customizable dashboard** - Drag-and-drop widgets
- **Notification history** - View past notifications
